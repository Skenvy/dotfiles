> [!TIP]
> Proctor your user settings `~/.*` | `$HOME` with
[dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) --
[topic](https://github.com/topics/dotfiles),
[io](https://dotfiles.github.io/),

_This_ is _**my**_ dotfile repository. It follows the ["`$HOME` is a repo"](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/blob/main/devlog.md#home-is-a-repo) pattern, with bells attached. See the [devlog](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/blob/main/devlog.md) for more.

This dotfile repository is setup in a way that it follows "`$HOME` is a repo", in multiple ways.
1. "`$HOME` is _this_ repo" -- you can directly clone this on top of `$HOME`.
    1. You can *clone* this's [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home) (_my_ config, if you want the exact same config)
    1. You can **fork** this's [`main`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/main) (the core files for my "`$HOME` is a repo" setup)
    1. You can **fork** this's [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home) (_my_ config, if you want to start from but change it)
1. "`$HOME` is _another_ repo" -- you add this as a submodule in your own dotfiles repo ~= `$HOME`.
    1. You can _clone_ / **fork** / _remake_ this's [`base`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/base) and target this's [`main`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/main) or [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home)
    1. You can _clone_ / **fork** / _remake_ this's [`base`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/base) and target your fork of this's [`main`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/main) / [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home)

_My_ use cases are a combination of
1. For personal machines
    1. "`$HOME` is _this_ repo" :: "*clone* this's [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home)"
1. For work machines
    1. "`$HOME` is _this_ repo" :: "**fork** this's [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home)" to my work account [CloutKhan/dotfiles-base](https://github.com/CloutKhan/dotfiles-base)
    1. \+ "`$HOME` is _another_ repo" :: "_remake_ this's [`base`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/base) and target your fork of this's [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home)"

> [!TIP]
> The other provided use cases allow you to do the exact same thing, but with an emphasis on keeping your own forks of everything, in every case. I like what I've done here, but fundamentally dotfiles are "personal" configuration, so if you do like this pattern, you should fork it, because there's no guarantee I won't completely change this at any point. This's [`main`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/main) is an example of the setup, with some essentially unchanged config files as examples only. This's [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home) is the actual settings I use. If you kinda like the idea of this, but that's it, the [`main`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/main) branch's init commit contains the actual core files. Idk do what you want lol.

## Pre-use
### `git`+`ssh`
To use any approach, you'll need to have `git` installed, as well as `ssh`, and have the `ssh-agent` running, and your key added to the agent, and uploaded to GitHub. See [my ssh gist](https://gist.github.com/Skenvy/8e16d4f044707e63c670f5b487da02c0) for steps on how to handle setting up `ssh` on Ubuntu or Windows (pay close attention to the step for setting `"GIT_SSH"` if you're on Windows). If you already have `ssh` setup and `git` installed, then you're ready to continue to one of the below steps!
### `~/.include/*`
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A critical feature that underpins all approaches to using these dotfiles effectively, you should be aware of this directory. Different config files are allowed to independently expect or optionally hook various files that should or must be kept under `~/.include/*`. They provide a means for "core" or "centralised" or "shared" configuration to be kept in this repository, but also allows "extensible" configuration files, that are "core" files with the ability to seek out "extension" configuration files, that needn't or shouldn't be checked-in here. "Extensible" just means files that can attempt to parse other files in `~/.include/*` and will composite or allow overwriting of "core" (checked-in here) config, by the "extension" configuration files that you will have to maintain in `~/.include/*`.

> [!TIP]
> See both [`~/.include/.pre/README.md`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/blob/main/.include/.pre/README.md) and [`~/.include/.post/README.md`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/blob/main/.include/.post/README.md) for the two most commonly parsed folders, that provide suggestions on what config files to add in either place. For an illustrative example of this, have a look at [how to add your ssh key setup to `.bashrc`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/blob/main/.include/.post/README.md#bashrc-example).

## Use as "`$HOME` is _this_ repo"
If you're planning to accept this repo into your `$HOME`, you're doing so aware that these steps will destructively replace files of the same name that exist in your `$HOME` already.

You would typically be interested in following this step as one of the first things you do setting up a new machine, so the destructivity would be limited to only replacing the user files that the system had generated for you. If you're following this step at some other point well after you've been using your machine for a while, chances are that customisations and personal settings might have crept in to your local dotfiles.

If that is the case, you should try your best to extract whatever `diff` there is between your existing config and what's in here, and keep it under `~/.include/`. Alternatively, you could back up your existing config just in case, as an optional step listed in the below.

If you're going to just _clone_ this, then you wouldn't be able to checkin your `~/.include/*`'s, but if you **fork** this, you can checkin you `~/.include/*`'s.
### Steps
More than likely, `~` won't be empty, so `git` will refuse to clone into it.
1. If you have pre-existing checkout here, remove it; `rm -rf .git/`
1. Be in your home directory; `cd` works differently across `bash`, `pwsh`, and `cmd`
1. Make `~` the repo, add the remote, and set the head. ONLY `bash` or `cmd`, NOT `pwsh`.

#### Clone my [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home)
> [!CAUTION]
> **Destructively** overwrite the files of the same name as those checked in.
> ```bash
> git init && git remote add origin git@github.com:Skenvy/dotfiles.git && git fetch && git checkout -b home remotes/origin/home -f
> ```

#### Or, fork my [`main`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/main) / [`home`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/home) and clone your fork
[Fork this](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/fork), calling it `dotfiles`, and edit the following to point you `<YOU>`.
> [!CAUTION]
> **Destructively** overwrite the files of the same name as those checked in.
> ```bash
> git init && git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOU>/dotfiles.git && git fetch
> # Use only the core set on main
> git checkout -b main remotes/origin/main -f
> # Use and extend my home settings
> git checkout -b home remotes/origin/home -f
> ```

## Use as "`$HOME` is _another_ repo"
If you would like to utilise the configurations here as a base, but also be able to add and track your own `.include` files, then adding this as a submodule is what you want.
Using submodules, you can include and refer to this dotfiles repo inside of _another_ dotfiles repo, where you can track this repository and use its contents without ending up with a cluttered repository, while also maintaining your own `.include` files, as well as checking them in, whether for a public or private dotfiles repo.

If this sounds like something you want to try, you should add this repository as a submodule in your own dotfiles repository, and symlink its contents into `$HOME` (a script to do the linking is provided). This lets you use and stay up-to-date with changes to **this**, but also allows you to commit any additional files you need, provided they wont just get symlinked over by following this process. To read about what originally motivated me to provide two seemingly antithetical ways of consuming this repo, [see this](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/blob/main/devlog.md#submodule-original-motivation).
### Steps
#### Starting without a repository
If you do not yet have a dotfiles repository, and this is the way you intend to start one for the first time, or starting over, there's a few things to take note of.
Notably, some files "can't" be symlinked, in that the programs that read them won't be happy following symlinks, e.g. certain `git` configuration for example can't by symlinked as `git` won't follow symlinks.

You'll need to create a new repo that should match this's [`base`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/base). If you'd rather fork this and work out of your clone of your fork in this's [`base`](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles/tree/base) branch, that's fine too, but it should be easier to just put together the handful of files.

To begin your repository, you may start with a blank repository, and add two files;
1. `.gitignore` of just `*`
1. `.gitattributes` of just `* text=auto`

Which assumes that you will be only ever "force adding" with `git add -f`, and that you won't be checking in anything other than text files. These both exist in this repo with the same content, but they will be ignored by the symlinking script.

Now you have an "existing repository" with `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`, follow the next steps.
#### Starting from an existing repository
Here's how you would submodule this into another repository and symlink it into `$HOME`, whether you are submoduling **this** repo, or if you forked it and you're submoduling _your fork_.
1. If you use a `.gitignore` that is just `*`, this can conflict with adding a submodule, so temporarily `rm .gitignore`
1. If you'd like to fork this first, you can, and, say, call it `dotfiles-base`
1. Now you can track this as a submodule `git submodule add git@github.com:Skenvy/dotfiles.git`
1. Or if you forked `git submodule add -- git@github.com:<YOU>/dotfiles-base.git dotfiles`
1. The submodule and `.gitmodules` are staged, so `git restore .gitignore` and commit.
1. `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1. \+ `git submodule update --remote` to periodically retrack your modules's `HEAD`

Now with a `.gitmodules` file that places **this repository** in the `dotfiles` folder in the repo that has added this;
```ini
# If you submodulesd this directly --
[submodule "dotfiles"]
    path = dotfiles
    url = git@github.com:Skenvy/dotfiles.git
    branch = main # or home
# Or if you forked this and submoduled your fork of this --
[submodule "dotfiles"]
    path = dotfiles
    url = git@github.com:<YOU>/dotfiles-base.git
    branch = home
```
With the submodule initialised and updated we can now symlink its contents into `$HOME`.
> [!CAUTION]
> `CLOBBER_HOME=DESTRUCTIVELY` will **force** symlinks (`ln -sf`) to write over files.
> ```bash
> cd ~ && ./dotfiles/bin/dotfiles-submodule-symlinks # Safest.
> # Or, if you prefer to live on the edge..
> CLOBBER_CHECKEDIN_ROOT=REPLACE CLOBBER_HOME=GRACEFULLY ./dotfiles/bin/dotfiles-submodule-symlinks
> ```

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to maintain a `README.md` that will display on the github page of the repository that submodules this, because this process will clobber the including repository's root `README.md` with a symlink to **this** repository's `README.md`, you can get around this by placing your `README.md` you want displayed at `.github/README.md`, which is the first path for a `README.md` file that github will look for (even before a root `README.md`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that the process of linking files into `$HOME` wont touch several files, listed in the script. You should ideally have a `~/.gitignore` of just `*` and a `~/.gitattributes` of just `* text=auto`.
